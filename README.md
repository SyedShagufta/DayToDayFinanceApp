# daytodayfinanceapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a DayToDay Finance Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

1. clone this app to your system using the following command

    git clone https://github.com/SyedShagufta/DayToDayFinanceApp.git

2. Import this project in Android Studio or Vscode

- Open the Android Studio and select Tools from the menu bar and click on SDK Manager.
- In the newly open window click on the plugins and in the search bar search for Flutter and Dart and then install it.
- Now after installing Flutter and Dart we are ready to import a Flutter project. For that just go for File>New>Import Project.
- Now in the new pop-up window go for the directory in which the Flutter project is already available in this case we have a DayToDayFinance project. Click on that directory and we have successfully imported an existing Flutter project in Android Studio.
- Now there will be a default .dart page over there which has already a sample code written on it and we can check it by running the application by selecting Chrome web as our device and clicking on the Green play button to run the application and we can see our result on the web page.
